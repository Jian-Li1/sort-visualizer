Currenly we have Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, but will be adding a few more algorithms in future releases.

# Usage
If your system doesn't have Python installed already, install it <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>

Once you have Python installed, you need to install the PyGame library:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Run this command to run the program:
