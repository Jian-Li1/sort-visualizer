Currenly we have Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, but will be adding a few more sorting algorithms in future releases.

# Usage
If your system doesn't have Python installed already, install it <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>
<br><br>
Once you have Python installed, you need to install the Pygame library:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

Run this command to run the program:

```bash
python main.py
```

# Download
Note: Some browsers (such as Google Chrome) might mistakenly block the file when it's downloaded. In this case you want to click on "Continue" or "Keep" after the file is downloaded.
